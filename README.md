# ðŸ«˜Bean-Collector
A beginner friendly pygame project where you control a coffee mug and collect falling coffee beans before the time runs out. My first ever python project in May 2023, done with the help of AI, but what it did was sparked something in me for game development.

## What is Bean Collector?
*Bean Collector* is a simple yet charming arcade-style game built using **Pygame**, where you control a coffee mug and try to collect falling beans before time runs out. Each successful catch increases your score, and the challenge ramps up as the game speeds up.

This project was not just a gameâ€”it was the *spark* that ignited a much larger journey into game development.

## A look back
When I started this project in May 2023, all I knew about python was:
```python
print("Hello World")
```

I had little to no clue how games were made, how pygame worked, what pygame was, how OOP worked.
My tutor was AI. I asked it questions like:
*What is a Sprite?*
*What is a sprite collision function and how does it work?*
*What is a sprite group?*
*What is the purpose of def__init__()?*
*What is a clock?*

These are just a few questions that got me through this project.
What began as a project quickly turned into an obsession as this was my first step into the vast and mesmerizing world of game development.

## How to run the game?
1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. Make sure the following assets are in the same directory:
   - `bean.png`
   - `mug.png`
   - `background.png`
   - `collision_sound.wav`
   - `score_sound.wav`

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What I learned
- Basics of **Pygame** (sprites, events, surfaces, blitting)
- Handling **keyboard input** and **collision detection**
- Using **AI assistance** to build something I didnâ€™t know was possible
- That starting *before youâ€™re ready* is the best way to grow

## Final thoughts
*Bean Collector* isnâ€™t just a game â€” itâ€™s a time capsule. A snapshot of where I was, what I dreamed of, and how I took that first leap into the unknown.

To anyone reading this: if youâ€™re standing at the start of your own coding journey â€” uncertain, intimidated, or curious â€” I hope this inspires you to just *start*. You never know where it might take you.
